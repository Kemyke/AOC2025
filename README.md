# Advent of code 2024 puzzles
These are my solutions for each day. I don't do any refactors after I have the correct answers, so these are the first working versions. Still in C#. When it is possible I keep the part 1 and part 2 of the solution together. However when part 2 needs modification which affects the code of part 1, then only the final version will be uploaded (so the solution for part 2).
